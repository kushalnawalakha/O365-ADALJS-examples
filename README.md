# O365-ADALJS-examples
In single page applications (SPAs) you consume REST endpoints to retrieve and change data. With Web API you can secure these endpoints using Azure AD and authenticate to these endpoints with OAuth 2.0. Active Directory Authentication Library for JavaScript (ADAL JS) helps you to use Azure AD for handling authentication in your SPAs. The sources can be found on GitHub. In [this blog](http://nickvandenheuvel.eu/2016/01/06/authenticate-an-office-365-user-with-adal-js/) post I describe how to authenticate an Office 365 user (which is an Azure AD user) to a Web API endpoint with ADAL JS.
